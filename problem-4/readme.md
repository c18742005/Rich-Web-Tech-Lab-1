Change 1:
    My first change is a really simple change which changes the images of cats to dogs (dogs are cuter).

Change 2:
    Adding to my first change, I've now changed all the heading tags to say "Cats are awesome. But dogs are better".
    I also added some style attributes which change the font color to blue and the font family to verdana.
    I used the setAttribute method as I was setting more than one style change.

Change 3:
    I also changed each p tag to say "This website is now about dogs." while adding a style attribute to transform
    text to be all UPPERCASE. I used the color attribute to change the font color.

Change 4: 
    This change selects all divs and uses Math.random to produce a random RGB color value for each div. This random
    color is then assigned as the font color for each div, making the web page really colorful!
    I used the color attribute along with template literals to assign the random color to each div.

Change 5:
    This is my most complex change and involves making the body background colour animated. This effect can be seen
    most clearly on websites where the body tag can clearly be seen e.g. https://www.google.ie/
    I used the setAttirbute method on the body tag to set the color gradient and background size I wanted.
    I then used the animate method to animate the background by moving its position resulting in a really colorful
    background that is constantly changing.

Change 6:
    This is a fun little change designed to confuse the user by making them think all of the buttons are still 
    loading (they're not, they're all usable). I did this by swapping out all the buttons of a website with the cog
    icon from fontawesome. 
    I first created a new css stylesheet and appended it to the head tag. Then I cleared the text in each button,
    created an i element for each button with the Fontawesome classes that were needed before appending them to the 
    button elements.
